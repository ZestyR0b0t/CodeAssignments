        // TODO: Add enums for rank and suit! You can define enums right in this class, if you want them to be "paired" (associated) with the class itself.
        //       When you define an enum within another class, you need to qualify the name of the enum with the outer class name. So if I define an "Action" class,
        //       and I define a "Type" enum within that class, if I want to refer to that enum outside of the "Action" class, I would need to refer to it as "Action.Type".

        // Valid Ranks: Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace
        // Valid Suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades
    }
